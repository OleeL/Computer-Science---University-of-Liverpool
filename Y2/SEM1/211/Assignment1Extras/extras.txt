                        Verify sender address

Intead of the user typing in their own email address. The 
address is now created by the program. The generated address
is generated from the username@theComputerName. The user will
not be able to change their email address unless the username
or computer name is not found by their operating system.

                         Additional Headers

Upon downloading something from HTTP, it will be attached to
the header of the email in the format:

```
Content-Length: 76
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Files included: test.txt
```

                           CarbonCopy

I implemented a carbon copy system. This included creating a
field in the user interface. The names of the email which is
being cc'd to is separated by commas. White space will be
irrelevant like so: 

'oli@mail.com,viktor@mail.com,cmn@w.com , asd@mail.com'

This will be then switched to

'CC: oli@mail.com, viktor@mail.com, cmn@w.com, asd@mail.com'

That will then be put into the header of the email and sent
to the recipients

                        Follow redirections

If the http server replies with a 301 or 302 status code,
this means that the link that was provided was to redirect 
the user to another host and or path. The data downloaded 
will now be fethched at the redirection given from the 
website.
